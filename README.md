# Grint

By Mark Narain Enzinger

## Overview

Grint is a library, made for calculations with numbers of arbitrary lenght. The word 'grint' is a blend, created by connecting the words 'greater' and 'int' (integer). Currently avalible arithmetic functions are:
- Comparison (>, <, =)
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Before starting this project, I wrote a program to calculate the square root of a number by using the "Shifting nth root" algorithm. By using this algorithm a large number of decimal places of a square root can be calculated. But because there are certain parameters in this algorithm, that continuously grow bigger, I needed functions, that could handle these big numbers. 

## Used Environment

- Windows 11
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.8.6)
- Atlassian Sourcetree (optional)
